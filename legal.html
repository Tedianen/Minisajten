      <h2>About</h2>
      <b>Ted created a website about the game World of Tanks because he is a passionate player and wanted to share his 
        knowledge and strategies with other players. He wanted to create a community where players could come together to discuss the game, 
        share tips and tricks, and improve their gameplay. Additionally, he wanted to provide a resource for new players to learn about the 
        game and get started on their own World of Tanks journey. The website also includes helpful information such as tank reviews, 
        patch notes and update, latest news and much more which makes it a one stop destination for all the WoT enthusiasts. Overall, 
        Ted created the website 
        as a way to contribute to the World of Tanks community and help others enjoy the game as much as he does.</b>
